# Project Name
Weekend SQL To Do List

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
This project was to create a "To Do" application.
Tasks to be completed:
-Create a front end interface that allows user to add tasks to the to do list.
-When a task is added front end refreshes and shows all tasks to be completed.
-Add complete and delete buttons,  complete status changes color to indicate that task has been completed. Delete button removes the task.
-When the task is created it should be stored on the database, the status of said task should also be stored on the database.  Removing the task on the front end should also remove it from the database.
-Use CSS to improve look of to do application.

Steps taken:
Set up all necessary files and folders
Built front end structure in HTML
Built a database to store data sent
Wrote a function for click listeners and gather user input "tasks" in client js.
Wrote a a post function to save tasks entered in js, wrote a post route to store that data.
Wrote a render function to append information to the DOM, included was an if else statement that would append appropriate buttons and change task background color based on status.
Wrote a get function and route to retrieve the data.
Wrote put function to update the status of the tasks on both frontend and database.
Wrote a delete function to remove tasks from both the front end and the database.
